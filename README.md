# simple-data-mining
This is a data mining and analysis technique that was built and developed under a week for the OpenEd coding challenge.

ABOUT:

The ipython notebook is detailed with the project aim and the general algorithm used in the process.
This program scrapes the data from a given database (included with the project) and then performs analysis on it on basis of the defined algorithm and helps in getting helpful data regarding the general educational trends in the states and lists certain steps for the government for positive results.


Developed for the OpenEd Hackweek Challenge, "Government of India DataScience Challenge".

INSTRUCTIONS:

Open the ipython notebook using Jupyter, Enthought Canopy or any similar software. Keep the location of the other files in the master folder as it is, otherwise, change the location of whatever file you want to move in the project source code itself.
